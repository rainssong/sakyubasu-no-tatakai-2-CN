"zzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz...."
"zzzzzzzzzzzzzz....."
"*敲门声* *敲门声*"
"zzzzzz....嗯嗯嗯?"
"*砰* *砰* *砰*"
"声音1: 快从床上滚下来,你这懒鬼!"
"声音2: 这不是对待我们女主人的态度!"
"声音1: 哦...抱歉..快从床上滚下来,你这懒惰的婊子!"
"声音2: 你这个混蛋!!!!"
"呃...外面都给我闭嘴。"
"你惹我们生气了!"
"闭嘴,你这个漂浮的粉色垃圾。"
"感觉我好像睡了好几年。"
"我怎么会让这么没用的人打败我?"
"我觉得你不明白这是我1000年来第一次用正经床。"
"这是我的床,我当然明白。"
"你想要什么,比兹?"
"如果你忘了,我们正在打仗。我不想让你的愚蠢害死我所有的人。"
"这意味着是时候训练了。我在蜂巢的主庭院设置了一些基本训练。"
"没有关于当前形势的长篇大论?"
"佩库尼亚会在她到达时处理那些。现在,你需要学习战争的艺术。"
"我已经统治过一次冥界了,你知道的。"
"是啊!女主人是最棒的!你只是因为输了而生气!"
"如果我的屁股疼是因为...算了。我们开始吧。"
"我们都会死的。"
"哦别这么消极;不过我们确实需要决定下一步怎么走。"
"别担心,这个决定已经替你做好了。"
"很方便。什么消息?"
"伊拉尼亚不会让你直接与她交战,她正在建造一个巨大的远程冲击炮。"
"她到底是从哪里搞到材料和技术来建造这个大型死亡激光的?"
"嗯,我必须装装样子!不过我一直在拖延建造,你还有三天时间先发制人。"
"如果我是伊拉尼亚,我会在哪里建造巨型死亡机器?"
"瓦诺雷尔的塔楼。"
"说对了,姐妹。顺便说一句,粉色很适合你。"
"别以为我不知道你的秘密,叛徒。"
"姑娘们,姑娘们。让我们都冷静下来。所以我们向南进军?越过盲门?"
"没错,这是最直接的路线,但全力进攻是个错误。如果伊拉尼亚决定进军,机械之门撑不住的。"
"一个机器人小队发疯占领了一小块冥界,我就永远听不到尽头!"
"三天...我们别无选择。留下你认为足够守住防线的兵力。其余的跟我们南下。"
"遵命..."
"嗯...我得拒绝参与。祝你好运,记得尽可能回收硬件!"
"我们应该强攻;有预见或没有,我们应该能及时拿下塔楼。"
"我是说这明显是个陷阱。瓦诺雷尔知道我们要来,她会在每个转角伏击我们。"
"我觉得我没什么办法对抗她的幻术。我以为我在盲门设置的屏障足够强大可以保护它。"
"显然不够。她的魔法很强大,但仍然基于冥界的能量。我想我需要请个人帮忙。"
"(来到我身边)"
"你在做什么?"
"闭嘴，比兹，我在集中精力！"
"(来到我身边)"
"(你的女主人在召唤)"
"什么都没发生。"
"她说了闭嘴，比兹！"
"等着看..."
"...."
"再等等..."
"你叫我?"
"我明白了。不错的把戏。"
"布里吉！太好了！"
"比泽尔巴女士。你今天看起来不错。希望你适应良好你的转化。如果需要帮助请告诉我。"
"我想我很好。"
"提基，你看起来和往常一样开心。很高兴看到你安然无恙。"
"哦.我.天.啊.在蜂巢生活太棒了!到处都有好多东西,每个人都很忙碌来来往往,然后那些吞噬者都在说'这太糟了',而我就说'这太棒啦啦啦啦啦'"
"确实，看起来你一直在享受——"
"我的意思是，如果你不再住在臭臭的地面上，那又有什么关系呢？？！？！？你认为他们会感激能离开那个岛，但不OOOOOOO 就是抱怨，抱怨，抱怨，抱怨。我的意思是，你认为他们应该表现出一些感激之情！"
"也许我们可以稍后再聊，小家伙。"
"布里格，我们需要某种天使护符或祝福，或者一些保护的胡言乱语，以看透我们姐妹的幻觉。"
"抱歉，女主人，但由于您自己是恶魔，任何尝试施加护符的行为都会导致您自己的毁灭。"
"哈！"
"如果我们不带计划走进她的领地，她会轻而易举地摧毁我们。"
"我会陪伴你，驱散我们遇到的任何幻觉。"
"你不会被想念吗？怀疑你正在带领一支恶魔突击队穿越虚空领域？"
"不，女主人，神圣的存在已授予我休假，以进一步观察伊拉尼亚升天后的政治后果。"
"所以你的假期其实是不同的工作？"
"万物皆有秩序，女爵比兹尔巴。"
"集合部队，我们向南进军。"
"一旦我们穿过山谷，挡在我们和瓦诺雷尔之间的唯一障碍就是阴影瀑布。"
"你认为这会有多难？"
"很难说……如果我们能快速行动，可能在他们的部队能在城门后集结之前就能围攻他们。"
"下令移动，开始审问转化者；我想知道瓦诺雷尔的弱点。"
"嘿，布里吉？"
"是的，提基小姐？有什么我可以帮忙的吗？"
"你注意到女主人有什么不同吗？"
"定期扫描显示她的能量水平已经开始超出她原本的能力。"
"是的，我知道……她的追随者越多，她就越强……但是我想……"
"还有别的事吗？我可以请求进行医疗检查。"
"不，不，我不是说她有什么问题……但是我觉得她似乎……呃……"
"你们两个在喋喋不休什么？快点动起来！"
"啊！没什么！来了，女主人！"
"嗯。"
"女主人，如果您不介意，我想和您说几句话。"
"怎么了，黄油杯？"
"虽然我无法检测到您身体上有什么问题，但其他人注意到您的行为有所变化。您感觉还好吗？"
"我感觉非常好——这是我几个世纪以来感觉最好的时候。谁在说不一样的话？比兹？ 几次好的操她应该能让她清醒过来。"
"不，女主人，我相信女爵比兹尔巴对您的强烈仇恨使她不关心您的福祉。"
"然而，您希望她反复遭受肛交的欲望，说明了前面提到的变化：您最近似乎异常残忍。"
"生活是残酷的。告诉这些\'其他人\'别再纠结了。你觉得我在乎-"
"女主人？"
"到底发生了什么？"
"她在说话时突然倒下了。"伤害并非身体上的。"
"请告诉我她会死。"
"AHHHHHHHHHHH! 什么什么什么！发生了什么！快做点什么！"
"她稳定，但失去知觉。"
"我们没有时间了。准备部队；我将对阴影瀑布发起攻击。"
"AWWWWWWWW 你确实爱她！"
"看来艾瓦洛莉亚女士并不需要清醒，她的力量依然存在。"
"哦...好吧，我将假装比兹真的爱她！"
"天使，照顾好她。粉色的东西，去自杀吧。部队。向东。现在。"
"遵命，指挥官。"
"那么你为什么表现得这么疯狂？"
"我不知怎么地受到了伊拉尼亚的影响，她试图让我生气。鲁莽。"
"源头检测到。阴影无法保护你，愤怒的先驱！"
"即使是你也会被她的火焰净化，天使！"
"该死的....抓住她！"
"她正朝荒原走去，我们要追吗？"
"啧。不，我们是来找瓦诺雷尔的，我们不能再分心了。让梅基扎来吧。"
"好的，艾娃，准备好面对了。"
"她上次做了什么？"
"呃……我不记得了……好像是用镜子对付她……"
"欢迎回到超级团队！"
"我想在再次被赋予这个角色中找到一些小乐趣。"
"我现在要一直听这个吗？"
"嘘，比兹，你应该高兴。现在是场比赛。"
"假设佩库尼亚保持中立，是的，三对三。"
"哦，我敢肯定她会在某个时候背叛我们，这就是她的本性。现在我们只需要想出接下来该做什么。"
"我们应该往东去……"
"比兹？你怎么了？"
"不！该死！我告诉过你们没有足够的力量来守住！"
"我相信女爵比兹尔巴正在接收来自蜂巢的心灵求救信号。"
"维纳拉和索姆娜都已经向蜂巢进军。这整个事情是为了引我们向南。"
"具有讽刺意味的是，我并不知道有任何欺骗。我想这意味着伊拉尼亚认为我会失败。真是，这颗星星已经堕落得太远了..."
"该死。该死，该死，该死。附近有任何传送门可以使用吗？"
"没有。等我们回去的时候就太晚了。他们已经推进到梳子地带了。"
"布里吉特，你可以传送。我需要你在那里。拖住他们，召集虫群领主，坚守阵线。"
"Mistress, I have been pushing the boundries with my involvement as it is. If I were to wage war directly in defense of..."
"That is an ORDER, Bridgette. We can not lose the Hive!"
"As you wish."
"We need to head north immediately."
"No. We head through The Wastes. We take the Mech Gate and flank their army at The Comb. Vanorel, you can get us saftely though The Phase?"
"Hold on! We can\'t simple march through The Wastes, we will be ambushed at every step by those damn machines!"
"It\'s done."
"If we go back the way we came, they will just push us back and we lose all the ground we gained."
"This way we can spear through their armies. Maybe even seperate one of them. We make it four on two and the war is ours."
"So be it, Mistress."
"I hope Bridgette is okay..."
"Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy! Couldn\'t help but notice you were in the neighborhood."
"I was wondering when you were going to show up. I am going to clean up your little robot problem."
"You know, I should really charge you for the units you convert."
"Add it to my tab."
"Hah! Good to see you got your humor back, Beez. Van, you are looking... satisfied."
"Does not the star shine brightest during the darkest night? Is not the squalored diamond the one that shines luminous?"
"No, the polished one would have a much better reflective quality."
"Sigh."
"Did you just say \'Sigh\'? Why didn\'t you just actually sigh?"
"FOCUS, PEOPLE."
"Right, anyway, I was thinking we might be able to do a little quid pro quo bargain here."
"Do tell."
"The Mechiza MCU is somewhere in the Waystation. You get me in, I will counter hack the unit and bring all of them back in line."
"So you get your robot army back and...? Where is my quo?"
"You get to keep the ones you bang!"
"WAIT A MINUTE!!!! How do you bang a robot?"
"Penis in vagina?"
"You built the robots with dicks? Why?"
"Why wouldn\'t I?"
"You were preparing to fight the avatar of Lust and you gave your robots dicks? Why give them genitals at all?"
"I hear words coming out of your mouth, but they are not making sense."
"Heh. Okay, we will seige the Waystation; you go in and disable this MCU. Then we get free passage back to the Shadow Forest."
"Deal. Although I can only promise as far as the Mech Gate."
"We might actually pull this off."
"Giving Pecunia her army back wins the prize for dumbest shit you have done so far."
"What choice do we have? Bridgette can\'t hold the line forever."
"Rebooting core systems... checking uplinks and server status... we are looking... oh, crap."
"What?"
"A small group of Mechiza disconnected from the MCU and are still operating outside my control."
"And they are located where?"
"Mech Gate. Hey, at least it is on your way!"
"Why don\'t you deal with them while we play hero at the Comb?"
"No can do, sis. I need to secure the networks and purge the Wastes of any other rogue units."
"Shocking."
"Hey, you get what you pay for."
"Just a little longer, Bridgette..."
"Reinforce the eastern pass! Scouting units, report."
"We won\'t hold out another night. Their main force has crossed into the Shadow Forest and is on the Royal Path now."
"We WILL hold. Send Stingers to disrupt their march. Have the gorgers begin digging supply tunnels south."
"Yes, Commander."
"Commander... the east gate has fallen... we must withdraw to the Hive..."
"Please rally our remaining forces to fallback position Beta."
"We cannot win. If we stay, we will be destroyed."
"Then prepare yourself for the Abyss. We make our final stand here."
"...... ALL REMAINING SQUADS TO BETA!"
"Strange... our scouts are reporting that the Esuriens are falling back to the Royal Way."
"Bridgette must have held them back; although..."
"What is it?"
"I don\'t know, it must be because of how far we are, but I can\'t really feel her anymore."
"I hope she is okay!"
"I am sure she is fine. She is practically invincible."
"Bridgy... please be okay..."
"Bridgette! This can\'t be..."
"That is one dead angel."
"How is this even possible?!?!"
"WHA... N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO! WHAT!"
"Van, take Tiki away from here."
"Come little starlight, this is not for you to see."
"S-s-she can\'t... I mean sheee....."
"I was able to secure... what is going on here?"
"They killed her."
"Oh snap. How is that even possible?"
"I don\'t know."
"There is a lot of negative energy permiating the wound. This was definitely a planned assasination."
"I sent her here. Irania KNEW that I would send her here."
"Well, I\'ve sealed off the Sand Gate, so their only retreat is north via the Royal Way."
"Scouts are reporting that Somna has already passed through Death\'s Reach. We won\'t get to her in time."
"Then we go after Vinara."
"Go, I can take care of her body and clean up here. Don\'t worry."
"Thank you, Pecunia."
"Oh it is my pleasure."
"Did it ever occur to you that we are just playing into Irania\'s hands again?"
"Yes."
"And.... you don\'t care?"
"No."
"Awesome. Great talk."
"I thought you of all people would understand."
"Tsk. You don\'t get me at all."
"We are catching up."
"Soooooooooooooo what are you going to do when we find her?"
"I\'m going to make sure Bridgette rests in peace."
"You can\'t kill Vinara; we need her alive to marshal her troops to our cause."
"Anger roused to rival that of a burning sun! Truly shall this wild passion engulf our sisters in its callous flame?"
"How can a flame have calluses? It doesn\'t even have SKIN!"
"She meant uncaring."
"Then why didn\'t she SAY uncaring?!?!"
"If Pecunia has sealed the Sand Gate like she said, then its a straight shot through the mountains."
"HEEEEEEEEEEY DON\'T IGNORE ME!!!"
"Fortify the Royal Gate, resupply and get ready to move into Death Reach."
"The leg bone\'s connected to the knee bone! Knee bone\'s connected to... some sort of bio-integrated interface? Interesting..."
"Oh shit, you have some sort of biomesh underlay with a dick shit ton of recouperative micro-organics. No wonder you bitches are so hard to kill!"
"Hmmm....hmmm.... yep the negative energy disrupts the nano-tech\'s link rendering a small window of vuln..."
"Cease and desist."
"FUCKING! Where did! How! You scared the shit out of me! Aaaannnnd.... I can\'t move. Why can\'t I move?"
"Please do not resist. I am here to reclaim Commander Bridgette\'s body. We appreciate your cooperation."
"You... don\'t seem too upset that she is dead.  Aren\'t you going to rain down holy vengeance upon Irania for your fallen sister?"
"Dead? There is a reason for all things, Lady Pecunia. Have a pleasant day."
"Hmmmmmm... Welp, that could have gone worse, I guess. Back to the drawing board."
"Somen brin me a drenk..."
"Shhhhhh... right.... away...."
"Evva bein a stupd bish... Iranea bein a stuped bitsh. Everyn bein\' stupid bitchesh."
"I\'ll try not to be insulted."
"Ahhh yu knw I didn men yoo, Sommy. Wannah drunk?"
"I guess. I am sure Eva will be kicking down your door any moment, though."
"Ye, I guss gonnah hav te fite her..."
"It is all so tiring. Is it really better to fight for Irania? This is all so much effort."
"Hmmmm... well fuk thet min contrul bulshet! Imma kik Eva in her fuckn tits!"
"What\'s our plan for Vinara?"
"Well, don\'t be fooled by her drunk act. She is extremely calculating."
"She seems like she would throw a great party!"
"Oh hell yes, she has thrown some ragers! Where do you think I learned not to mix beer and wine?"
"YAY! You need to turn her so we can PARRRRRR-TAAAAAAAYYY!"
"Heh... she... no. She has to pay for Bridgette."
"Hmmmm not bad, but I think yer losin\' yer touch."
"Seriously?"
"What? I\'m obligated to tell ya the truth, no? Was better the last time."
"HOW RUDE!"
"Ah I\'m sure it ain\'t yer fault, wee one; a dick can\'t thrust itself."
"Vinara."
"Hmm?"
"How did you do it?"
"Do what? Ya got ta be more specific, melon tits."
"How did you kill Bridgette?"
"*GASP*"
"I told ya, sis, I ain\'t got no clue what you are talkin\' about."
"The Divine at the Comb. Your forces were there. They said they were sent to kill her."
"My forces... No, ya twat, we were coming down the Royal Way when the order came to fall back."
"There were Esurians on the Blood Path and assaulting The Comb!"
"Oh. My advance troops were deployed to support Pecunia, they were under her command."
"....."
"I mean you had ta know that she was playin\' both sides."
"........."
"Its Pecunia fer blood\'s sake. She would betray herself if there was profit in it."
"............."
"Mistress? You look red. Well... I mean... MORE red..."
"Secure the Blight Gate. Vanorel, go tell Beezelba she is un-grounded then secure the paths to The Wastes."
"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh Pecunia is in troouuuuubbbbllleeeeee!"
"It is time to change the terms of our deal. Vin, you are with me, we head South in the morning."
"Hey... let\'s all just calm down here..."
"BITCH YOU ATTACKED ME!"
"Okay, okay! The Mechizas got a bit aggressive when they thought you were a threat..."
"Did you kill Bridgette?"
"Yes. Yes, I did. But I had a good reason!"
"What possible reason could you have?"
"Well... there was... yoink!"
"She went through a portal!"
"Don\'t let her escape!"
"Hey.. hey where the fuck you goin?!"
"Gone."
"What did we miss?"
"Eva and the little pooper just jumped through a portal and disappeared."
"That fucking idiot. Come on, we need to scour The Wastes for them."
"Where the fuck are we..."
"I don\'t know! Underground somewhere? I CAN\'T BREAAAAATTTTHHHHHEEEE!"
"Calm down, spaz, there is plenty of air. This looks like some abandoned lab."
"Abandoned for about 1000 years, actually."
"Well I hope you like it, because this is where it ends for you."
"Fitting. This is where it all began."
"Now that you are good and fucked, spill it."
"Spill what? I really don\'t remember anything."
"Okay, well what is the last thing you remember?"
"The war? You broke through the southern bunker and... it all gets foggy."
"The last thing you remember is the first war?!?!"
"THAT WAS 1000 YEARS AGO!!!!!!"
"Whoa.  Haha! I guess I really had some information to protect to go back that far!"
"You took some sort of pill."
"Small? Blue? Looked kind of like a little dildo?"
"YEP THATS IT!"
"Oh yeah, those memories are gone. That thing is practically a factory reset on the brain."
"You mentioned something about Dad. About him letting me win?"
"Sorry, I got nothing."
"Well at least we will get free equipment now!"
"Oh, no, sorry. As a precaution during the first war, I put in some redundant coding."
"Yeah, I remember that, when you were converted, the market price on everything went into lockdown."
"Hey, a girl has to make a living!"
"How do we get out of here?"
"I\'ll open a portal."
"Great. Tiki, go ahead through. Pecunia hold back a minute."
"What\'s up?"
"The dream eater... you made her."
"No shit? I actually got that project to work? Haha, I AM amazing!"
"I don\'t want her to remember what she is."
"Oh, she found out she is a robot, huh?"
"Well, she hasn\'t really said so... but... I just... I don\'t want it to be an issue."
"Right. Okay, I will find the access codes to her memory banks and make sure she doesn\'t remember."
"Sigh..... REALLY, Eva?"
"What?"
"You know I don\'t have time for this. I am the only one of us who actually has a real job to do."
"Then pull down your knickers. I\'ll stick one in \'ya, and you can get back to work!"
"Ugh... why must everything be such an effort."
"Hey! Come back here! Running takes more effort than sex!"
"I guess she has better things to do?"
"Not here."
"She probably went back to the rift."
"What did she mean that she was the only one with a real job?"
"She is in charge of regulating the demonic dream realm."
"What?!?! That seems pretty important for someone so... so..."
"Lazy?"
"Yeah....."
"Well she is not so lazy in the Dreaming. She actually beats a lot of ass."
"Whose ass?"
"When we were created, dad sort of... broke... our dimension. Which is already metaphysical. So... ha... he REALLY fucked up."
"Short story: bad stuff came out of the crack. Somna keeps it closed."
"Maybe we SHOULD leave her alone...."
"You know it is really pretty here..."
"It is quiet."
"Serene..."
"I guess I pictured it differently! I thought The Blight would be more blight-y? Like The Wastes?"
"Hmm? Dream Eaters are born in the Blight, how did you not know what it looked like?"
"I... huh... I don\'t know, I can\'t remember!"
"We need to go East."
"We could just go North. Into Demon\'s Claw."
"No... even if she isn\'t a threat, I need Somna joined. I don\'t know how strong Irania has become."
"..."
"......."
"..."
"What? What is with all the meaningful looks being exchanged?"
"She has broken at least 3 seals. That we know of, that is."
"So that is what she has been doing this whole time? And NONE OF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO TELL ME?"
"Hey, I erased my memory, how was I supposed to know?"
"What seals?"
"We go East. I need Somna."
"HEYYYYY WHAT SEALS!?!?!?!?"
"This might be rough..."
"What? WHY?"
"Somna was the longest holdout during the first war. She stalemated me for months."
"WE DON\'T HAVE MONTHS!!!!!!"
"Just need to stay calm and focus."
"Happy? Can I get back to dreaming now?"
"You really don\'t care about all of this do you?"
"Not really. Irania is in charge. You are in charge. Who cares? As long as I can do my job it is all the same to me."
"Yeah... how is that going by the way? The Phasmos were acting really weird."
"Well, I can\'t lie. We have been losing ground. Slowly. But still losing. There is something new in there, Eva. Something that doesn\'t belong."
"Geez, like that isn\'t vague and ominous."
"If I knew, I would tell you! Just... don\'t take too long with Irania. I might need you. All of you."
"That bad?"
"Oh, I am probably making it sound worse than it is. We have time... I just can\'t say how much."
"Hmmmm... I think it is best if I stay behind."
"Yeah. Okay, you win. I had no idea your forces took this all so seriously."
"It is what they were bred for. No, seriously, their entire being was built for this purpose!"
"Am I going to have any problems with the ones I take with me?"
"Nah, they should be fine. If you need me, you know how to call."
"So WHAAAAAT is the PLAAAAAAANNNNNNNNN?!?!?!"
"All out blitz. We rush and siege the castle."
"Assuming we do claim the claw, how do you plan on breaking the castle\'s fortifications?"
"Aye, the barriers are still up, \'an no matter how many hamburgers we make that ain\'t gonna change."
"I have some thoughts on that. For now, just worry about getting there."
"All that chantin\' was givin\' me a headache..."
"What DOESN\'T give you a headache?"
"Why, yer pretty face, wee one!"
"A\{41}W!!!!!"
"Eyes on the prize, ladies."
"This is the best Irania had to offer? Perhaps Eva is the better choice after all."
"Whoa. WHOA. STOP THE MOTHER FUCKING PRESSES!"
"Tsk. Forget I said anything."
"I knew it! You have grown to love me, haven\'t you? You are just a big, cuddly, smoochy-woochy, lovey-poo, aren\'t you?"
"You are only deluding yourself."
"Energy conveyance simulator worked like a charm."
"Perfect. Now it is time to bring down the barriers surrounding Irania."
"So the good news is that the tower generators themselves are exposed, and given our overwhelming numbers we should be able to seige them all at once."
"And the bad news?"
"The BAD news is that there is a short window in which we can bring them all down. If even one of us fails, the remaining tower will be able to repair all the others"
"So we all win. And once the towers are down?"
"Well... the energy barrier will dissapate and... we will still be stuck outside a heavily reinforced, entrenched, nearly unbreakable fortress."
"Is not nearly not none?"
"What does that even... ahem.. there is a small service entrance through the sewer network, but nothing you could bring an army through."
"So we focus them on our seige and I sneak in through the service gate and confront Irania."
"I suppose that could work, but it isn\'t like you can just walk in. You will have to fight your way through the castle."
"We can cross that hurdle when we come to it.  For now, we take down those towers."
"You heard the lady. Squads, form up! We prepare our final assault!"
"Sneaky sneaky sneaky!!!!!"
"Shh, keep it down. We should be able to get into the castle using this passageway."
"And Vanorel pretends to be you outside, right? YOU ARE SO SMART!!!!"
"Tiki! Shut it!"
"INTRUDERS SHALL BE EXTERMINATED"
"Shit! There is a Gate Guardian somewhere down here! Destroy it and we are in..."
"I have opened the Hive\'s armory to those greasy little furballs you call subjects."
"Oh don\'t they look cute in their little armor. Seriously, what is the point of all this?"
"Because you can\'t just fuck your way through our sisters\' armies."
"Worked before!"
"No, you got lucky before. You turned Irania first and let her destroy everyone\'s armies."
"True... I suppose she did do a lot of the heavy lifting. Especially when I made her suck that sloth giant\'s..."
"Be serious. You promised you were different this time. These are the lives of our people at stake."
"Fine, don\'t be so dramatic."
"Let\'s begin."
"The Hive\'s teleporters are online, and you can use them to bring your squad mates into combat."
"Good, let\'s bring all the little bastards out to play!"
"Yeah, that is not how it works. The teleport system has limited energy capacity. It will take a while to spin up to full potential."
"Earn and burn, eh?. Am I supposed to do a little dance while I wait?"
"You can summon a unit once you have enough energy, and that energy will be reserved to anchor them in this location."
"Yeah, yeah, I got it."
"The stronger the minion the more energy it costs to keep in play. Don\'t overextend yourself."
"Tutorial: Units cost mana to summon; your current mana is represented by the blue circles on your GUI, and the mana cost of a unit is the blue number at the top of the token."
"Tutorial: Click on your unit token, then select a starting zone to summon it to. When you are done, hit \'Begin Combat\'"
"Your minions will move and attack of their own accord. Keep this in mind as you plan your strategy."
"They should do what I TELL them to do."
"They can only do as they are able.  Don\'t be a petulant child."
"Tutorial: All units have a movement and attack range. Units will automatically move and attack according to these values at the end of your turn."
"My scout can move farther than your tank and attack twice per turn. If she passes your tank, you will lose."
"Unless, of course, I BLOCK your scout with my tank. This isn\'t brain surgery, Beez."
"Move your tank to intercept."
"Tutorial: Aside from summoning new units, during your turn you can have units switch to an unbocked lane. Click the unit, then click the new lane."
"Tutorial: All classes have a shared skill. Scouts can attack twice per turn. Any unit hit by a Tank can\'t switch lanes for two turns. Use your tank to win the match."
"Tutorial: All units have an ATTACK (Red) and HEALTH (Green) value."
"Tutorial: Attack Power will determine how much damage they do to enemy units with each strike."
"Tutorial: If a unit\'s Health value reaches 0, it is dismissed from the field and its owner gains back its mana cost."
"Tutorial: Pay attention to a unit\'s Class and Special skills as these often have significant impact on Attack and Health."
"Congratulations, you now have the battle acumen of a 4-year old."
"I feel so wise now... so empowered... maybe... just maybe someday I will be as great as you."
"Eventually your power will wane, and I will kill you."
"Nonsense, poopy-pants. You will come to love and respect me like good little sister."
"Little? I was born first."
"I\'m talking about your tits."
"... I hope Irania burns you from existance."
"You are so cute."
"Pecunia should be ariving soon with word from the East. End this and let\'s head back."
"Hmmm... no. Something is missing."
"What?"
"The FUCKING, Beez. Where is the fucking?"
"There... there is no place for that in combat!"
"Oh, but I think there is. We will need more troops, and for that to happen, I need my influence to spread."
"Your position as a commander is too important, you can\'t go running out on the field to fuck everything."
"No, but I can empower my minions to spread my influence for me.  Like I did with your swarm."
"You... you did what?!"
"Bring another unit onto the field."
"Eva... you can\'t..."
"Do as you are told."

"Silent treatment? Seriously? Who is the 4-year old now?"
"..."
"I command you to speak, Beezy."
"You disgust me."
"That\'s better! Let\'s finish up here and head back."
"AH! What the hell!"
"Eva... take this seriously."
"Hey, it has been 1000 years, I am a bit rusty!"
"Let\'s start again..."
"And that, as they say, is that!"
"Let\'s just go."
"Cheer up, Beezy. Everything is going to turn out great."
"Fucking hell! What the fuck! Thats a weak one?!?!"
"What is going on here? Oh.... Eva... you should have called me.  This is out of your league."
"Anything you can do, I can do better!"
"Foul creature... return to your own false reality! I bani-"
"Hold up."
"Oh. You were serious?"
"Just give me an hour."
"I don\'t see any... what. the. fuck. is. that."
"Mid-level Shavees. Fairly standard for these types of breech."
"I am going to have sex with it."
"W-what?"
"I am going to bang that thing. I don\'t know how, but it is happening."
"I see... you will still have to suppress it first. I can banish it once you are done."
"Sounds like a plan! So Somna beats these things regularly?"
"She wouldn\'t even break a sweat with one this small."
"Pathetic. No one will give you glory."
"What the fuck, guys!"
"Respect must be earned."
"Hmmm...."
"Owned, bitch!"
"Crude - but vicious. You need refining; I will come with you."
"I would get indignant but, damn, I love your tits."
"I didn\'t think you cowards would show."
"How dare you insult our mistress!"
"She doesn\'t look that tough..."
"THREAT_DETECTED//HIGH"

"So this rabble is the best the other clans had to offer? Tsk."
"....."
"RUN AWAY!!!!!! HE IS GOING TO EAT OUR SOUUUUULLLLSSSSS!"
"You... attacked me...."
"Why did you attack me?"
"Aren\'t you like... going to eat our SOULS?!?!?"
"N-no? Why would I do that?"
"I guess the myth is more than the man... well, wolf... demon... thing..."
"Bobaksuez! Boba-AHHHH!"
"AHHHHHH!"
"AH!"
"AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
"AAHHHHHHH!"
"AH!"
"What are you all screaming about?"
"Out! Get out of my kitchen! All of you!"
"Gah! Stop throwing... OW! HEY! I\'m the Queen of... Ack!"
"I SAID OUT!"
"Hmmm not bad. It could use a little salt but decent for a donkey."
"Okay, I have to admit, your food is pretty good."
"Well enjoy it while it lasts, I have 21 television shows to go do."
"Nope your slate just cleared. You are coming with me."
"WHERE THE FUCK IS MY FILET!!!! YOU DONKEYS!!!"
"What the hell...."
"Something is wrong... looks at all those clones!"

"I think that is the last of them..."
"My fans are simply RAVENOUS! To think what they would have done with me!"
"Hmmmmmm... yeah..."
"W-what are you doing?"
"Thinking about what they would have done with you..."
"Ugh! Disgusting! But alas, I cannot stay here anymore... the press will be all over me."
"Consider yourself recruited. No one will be able to bother you in my personal guard."
"Get away you foul things!"

"Problems?"
"My fans can\'t control themselves! Oh, why was I born with such gifts?"
"She really is in trouble... Squad! To her aid!"
"Weak. Ineffective. Useless."
"You think you can speak to me like that?"
"The mountain cares not how the wind howls."
"It\'s over!"
"Your form is weak. Your strategy is lacking. You have no discipline."
"Yeah, I get enough of that from Beezelba, thanks."
"Lady Beezelba serves you?"
"Uh, yeah? How could you NOT know that?"
"I am no longer part of the swarm, but I will join you."
"Great! Wrap it up here and see you back at base."
"You have come to challenge me?"
"Recruit, ideally. Your reputation as a master fighter is impressive."
"And you believe yourself worthy of my talents?"
"Hello? Future Queen of the Netherealm? Conqueror of the First War? Great tits?"
"These things mean nothing. Prove your worth."
"You! You! Big.... stupid..."
"Someone go put this garbage on the street!"
"But... but... this our home too..."
"MEANIE! GET READY FOR BIG VOODOO!"
"Talking about dicks, are we?"
"Oh! Mistress! Me no see you. Drones being bad, attacking Gorgers!"
"Yes I saw that... you were very good in dealing with them.  Your magic... I haven\'t seen it before."
"Secret Gorger voodoo! Very strong! Given from Mask Spirit!"
"I want you to join my personal guard. I could use someone like you."
"Oh... oh, of course! Me get ready right now!"
"You stop picking on Gorgers! We here to serve Mistress just like you!"
"You filthy little bastards are ruining our home! You leave garbage everywhere! You are digging holes all through the comb! We need that nectar to survive!"
"Not our fault your Hive built so stupid! We no have wings to fly around! You no have doors so we make doors! We have rights!"
"Rights?! What rights?! This is our HOME! You... you are vermin! Pests! And it is far past time someone exterminated you!"
"Why you so mean?! You want fight? FINE! WE FIGHT!"
"Damn it all to... erggg!"
"Wooohoo! See we so good! I... I mean... you okay, mistress?"
"Don\'t make me hurt you."
"I thought you said you had been practicing?"
"Ooooooo you just too tough. We run 777 more drills!"
"Shouldn\'t it be 666?"
"Running drills, Lucky?"
"Ya we train good! But very slow."
"Well, alright then. Show me what you got."
"Damn it all to... erggg!"
"Would you like to try again? We can continue for as long as you like."
"Sometimes I really hate you."
"Piece of cake!"
"Would you like me to increase the difficulty? I can arrange for harder opponents."
"Ah... no. No, I am fine."
"Eh? Where is Beezy!"
"Lady Beezelba had other affairs to attend to. She asked that I facilitate this training session."
"Well, alright then. No cheating with invulnerability."
"What the hell... why are they attacking us?"
"The Hive is under attack sisters.... you must defend the Mistress..."
"Damn Vanorel! They have the gate\'s defenders under an illusion."
"To arms sisters! Defend our realm from these intruders!"
"We must protect our land!"
"Idiots! Weak minded fools! Slaughter them!"
"Turn who you can... kill that damn fairy!"
"Hehehehehehe...!"
"Hurk... damn, Vanorel!"
"So weak... Queen of the Netherealm! Hahahaaha!"
"Pull back! Regroup!"
"Don\'t let her escape!"
"Lady Vanorel sees all! The Crystal Forest will be your grave!"
"Gone... well there goes the element of surprise."
"You are not welcome here! Turn back at once Harlot Queen! Our mistress forbids your entry!"
"Harlot Queen has a rather nice ring to it. I know you meant it as an insult but still..."
"Look! All ways are blocked! You have no way into these lands... gaze on our vast army!"
"This... this isn\'t right... there was a canyon here that led..."
"Your tricks are of no use here. The light sees all truth."
"Tsk... I am rusty. They barely have any defenders... take the pass!"
"Wicked angel! You forget your place! We will not be broken!"
"The walls are closing in! Quick, retreat back to the Shadow Forest!"
"Harlot Queen... you are a fool!"
"Mistress... wait... its just an illusion!"
"Take as many Illosa as you can, they will be valuable allies as we penetrate my sister\'s land!"
"You really need to work on your word choice."
"What? It is a metaphor. After we pull Vanorel out of her tower I am going to penetrate her fertile land."
"Reinforce the eastern pass, she must not be allowed to reach Shadefall!"
"One, two, Eva\'s coming for you..."
"You must retreat with us!"
"Three, four, gonna make you a whore..."
"Go! We will hold them here!"
"Five, six, you\'re gonna suck some dicks..."
"For Vanorel!"
"Seven, eight... uhm..."
"Something, something masturbate?"
"Will you two focus!"
"Relax, we got this."
"Erk... tough little bastards..."
"Nine, ten, we\'ll defeat you again!"
"That is a terrible rhyme.... grrrr.... everyone pull back!"
"Bring her here."
"You will never take Shadefall! I may die here, but they have had enough time to fortify the city!"
"Die? You must be new. You know, I saw you talking to that cute little healer before the fight."
"She... you will never have her!"
"No... but you will. I wonder... what will she be thinking as you mindlessly ravage her in my name?"
"W-what?!?"
"Turn her. No need to be gentle about it."
"Tight little fairy... right away, Mistress!"
"(Mistress.....)"
"....."
"W-what! You should not be here!"
"Do you know who I am, whelp?"
"You are supposed to be free! She sacrificed herself so you would be freed!"
"Ah. The commander at the Break. You enchanted her like a little bomb. Eva turns her and boom."
"Don\'t you want to be free, Great Lady? Join us!"
"Masters of illusion and you actually believe in freedom.  Idiots."
"No use... she is still under the harlot\'s spell."
"You will never turn us!"
"You\'re right. Eva would turn you. I am going to massacre your tribe and burn your settlements to ash."
"Raise the gate! Defenders to positions!"
"There is no point to resisting, sisters..."
"No... I will save you!"
"This is not possible..."
"You will be free if we have to pummel your head!"
"Take up siege positions!"
"Kill them all."
"Yes, Commander."
"No... please... don\'t make her do this..."
"See.  This is why you aren\'t allowed to run things, Beezy."
"Tsk. Welcome back."
"You two make such a cute couple, I couldn\'t possibly condone murder."
"As if to serve is better!"
"Than death? It is. Vanorel will be joined and you will serve her again. I won\'t take away your lands. I promise."
"I... please make it quick."
"Quick and gentle."
"I liked you better the other way. Kindness has no place on the road ahead."
"And so she once again arrives at my steps, such a small thing casting such a long shadow over the realm."
"Why don\'t you come down here and we can talk about it? I know you LOVE to talk."
"You are a speck of dust in an eternal sea of light, what possible cause would I have to care about you or your cause?"
"Last I checked, you weren\'t a big fan of Irania, but I can\'t help but notice the giant lazer-o-death you got going on up there."
"Bend to one tyrant or bend to another. Perhaps my joints grow tired of such constant pain. Tell me, sister, what shall our truth be?"
"The air is shifting; I cannot detect the nature of her deceit, but we should prepare ourselves."
"Strike now! The longer you talk the stronger her position."
"For once, Beez, I think you are absolutely correct. No more words, Vanorel, if you won\'t come down, then we will drag you out!"
"Once again words fail where only swords can speak truth. Very well, then, come! Let us see whose truth is stronger!"
"Mistress, she was cloaking her forces. Multiple engagements being reported on the field. Illosa are flanking our vanguard."
"Take your squads and move to intercept, form rank around the tower. You just have to buy me enough time to break through her forward defense!"
"The dance goes on."
"Our mistress is beyond your reach!"
"Eva, we aren\'t going to hold long out here!"
"Pull back, reform and re-engage!"
"We\'ve broken through! Collapse your forces on the rear, we are heading up to the summit."
"You would feign to defile my home? Do you think I am so easily captured, a mere notch on your victory pole? This is my reality you are entering."
"Vanny, when I am done with you, you will be begging for my victory pole."
"This is all you have... jokes... how can you truly lead us if you cannot even take your own mortality seriously?"
"Blah, blah, something, something mortal coil."
"Mistress... we...."
"What is this?!"
"Your truth lies in those who worship you, they feed you their strength and eagerly you devour it like a dying star."
"You think I need them to defeat you?"
"Come, sister, the heavens await our triumph - we shall perform for them this day a grand ballet!"
"You were always a nutter, Van."
"This place ain\'t right."
"Just as the flowers bow to the morning sun, so shall our path be stable and secure in the warmth of my light."
"You couldn\'t have saved her for last."

"Shame. Oh well, I promise your tech won\'t go to waste."
"Quickly, before they can retreat!"
"Tssssss.... our mistress will feast on your bones!"
"More like our BONERS! Haha! Get it? Am I right? BONERS?"
"There is also a lubrication joke here somewhere..."
"Pshhh.... you will suffer the safe fate as her!"
"Her? Her who?"
"Shhhh....All will be consumed!"
"Annoying little shits, get out of our way!"
"What did you mean we would suffer the same fate as \'her\'?"
"Faaaaaaa.... we were sent to kill her.... we succeeded..."
"She can\'t mean..."
"Impossible. Right? We need to get to the Comb now."
"WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!?!?!!?"
"Where is your mistress hiding?"
"Faaaaa.... only death awaits you!"
"Seriously? Does Irania hand out a book of lame minion threats they all have to use?"
"Make sure to keep a few alive."
"Shaaaaaa... you will never reach her!"
"I am going to shove you into a pudding cup."
"There is a small squad of Esurians setting up a blockade at the Royal Gate."
"Heavily embedded?"
"Nothing we can\'t break."
"Haaaaa.... you will..."
"Oh shut it."
"Sssss...."
"You know she might have been waiting here hours just to deliver that line."
"Shaaaaaa... you will... never pass!"
"Hng... feel better?"
"Vinara isn\'t here. She must have already crossed into Death Reach"
"We need to catch her before she reaches the Blight."
"Be cautious. This is probably what she wants."
"Vinara!"
"Whyre you fallowin me yu crazee as betch?"
"I am going to make you pay for what you did to Bridgette!"
"Tha fucke is a Bridge tit? Yu don evn mak sens..."
"Don\'t even try it, I know the drunk shtick is an act."
"Yur fuckn face is dunk! I aint get time fer thes shet."
"You think you can run away?"
"Hhhhhhaaaaaaaa... shaaaaaaaa!"
"Shaaaaaaaa.... be.... gone!"
"Damnit, I can\'t let her get away!"
"Gone."
"She couldn\'t have gotten far."
"No time to rest, then."
"Go awae! I hav ah fuckn headack!"
"Stop running! You have nowhere to go."
"Im goin home, ya bish! Wars fuckn borin aneway."
"I am starting to think she really doesn\'t know anything about Bridgette..."
"Bullshit. Don\'t fall for her act. When I break her, we will find out the truth."
"Oh, sure, by all means, let\'s go chase her into her fortress where we will be surrounded by her forces. Great plan."
"You know what, Beez? I am sick of you second guessing me. Go home."
"What? You can\'t be serious."
"Did I stutter? I order you to return to the Hive. Sit on your stupid little throne, and fuck off."
"You don\'t literally mean..."
"I do now! Go home and finger that useless hole you call a cunt until I say otherwise."
"Faaaaahhhhhh... shhh......"
"Oh shut the fuck up. I\'ll get to you in a minute."
"Fffffaaaaaa.... leave... our land!"
"We have to get through..."
"She has to be holed up at the Blight Gate. Let\'s go dig her out."
"Ummmmmmmmmmm... okay! Sounds like a great plan!"
"Truly, does light not shine straight to it\'s destiny?"
"That\'s more like it."
"Shhhhhh.... defend.... the... gate!"
"You can\'t hide in there, Vinara! Tear that gate down! I want in!"
"To war, my children!"
"Fffffaaaaaa.... leave... the brewery!"
"Fall back... regroup and push the assault again!"
"As the ever-spinning stars cannot be stopped, so have our forces broken the gate."
"Alright. Fan out. Find Vinara, but don\'t engage."
"The sun might shine brightest on its own, but are you sure you wish nothing in your orbit?"
"No, this is my fight."
"Faaaaaaaa.... we are.... under... attack!"
"Well, she is not wasting any time."
"That bitch thinks she can come into my house?!"
"Fffffaaaaaa.... they have broken through!"

"We do not rest. We do not fall."

"You can\'t... we must secure the Dreaming..."
"I am not trying to keep you from doing your job! I just want to lord over you as your new Queen!"
"..."
"Okay, yeah, it sounded better in my head."
"We cannot let you pass."
"You CAN, actually."
"Arrogant fool."
"We do not fear. We do not die."
"Oh, go hump a log."
"Hurk... for each of us that fall, the Dreaming grows!"

"We have lost control of...hnnggggg"
"What the hell is going on here?"
"The festival grounds are closed. There is no celebration here."
"What is going on? Why do none of you seem concerned that we are at war?"
"This is not the real war."
"We do not flee. We do not hide."
"Oh, good, more mantras."
"Please... just... go."
"We need to find Somna."
"You MUST let her sleep!"
"We need to find Somna, now."
"Leave this place at once! You cannot disturb our Mistress!"
"I think the word you are looking for is \'should\'. Because I \'CAN\' do whatever I want."
"Your hubris blinds you and dooms us all!"
"We do not stop. We do not retreat."
"Hng... get everyone back!"
"I beg you... leave us be..."
"Maybe we should just..."
"You can begin the march north. I will take care of this."
"Be careful, Eva, all actions have consequences."
"Mistress, you cannot leave us! We need you to dream!"
"Sigh... it will be fine. I will return when we are done. Open the gate."
"No! You must stay!"
"Please... return to the Dreaming."
"Damnit, Somna, get your shit under control!"
"Please... don\'t leave us..."
"Sigh... stop being so dramatic."
"AWWWWWWWWWWWW... I don\'t think she should go either!"
"You aren\'t helping."
"You dare attack our gates? Where is Evaloria?"
"Sigh... a mere distraction. A ploy. Is my life reduced to such simple plots? Woe is to the final actor!"
"Irania\'s fire consume you!"
"We burn!"
"A twist! Cruel fate would but you want to see us succeed!"
"Your doors have been flung open! The stage is set! The final act begins!"
"Grrrrrrrrrrr... You have not the strength!"
"Gone, gone to the wind! Off to tell her tale of defeat"
"Shouldn\'t we go after her?"
"Oh, little one. So precious... yet so niave to the playwright\'s greater schemes."
"QUIT RINGIN\' THEM DAMN BELLS!"
"This is a sacred place, defiler! "
"Oh good - so ye got wine?"
"I cast you out!"
"Oof... can ye call me a cab?"
"Oye! You call that a proper brawl?!?"
"Hnnnggg... fall back...."
"Now where was that wine..."
"HEY! YOU NEED TO GET IN POSITION!"
"Yeah, yeah, I am goin\'"
"Surrender yourself and this land."
"We do not surrender!"
"I know. Eva requires me to say that. You should have no expectation to come out of this alive."
"Expected better."
"Hate to disappoint."
"Weaklings. You should be ashamed."
"You... hrk... you will suffer!"
"I sincerely doubt that. Hmm... I seem to have torn my armor. Be a dear and fetch me some leather."
"We seem to be fresh out."
"Shame. I am sure we can find some around here somewhere."
"Starting simulation test... green lights across the board..."
"Eva can not have access to the portal!"
"Port-oh, huh, look at that. I didn\'t even realize where we were. Don\'t worry, I\'m just here to test some new tech on your brains."
"Your technology is weak!"
"Clinical trial... failed... oof... resetting protocols for the next trial..."
"Simulation complete. Results favorable... lust energy convergence levels... stable!"
"What... have... you... done!"
"Built the future, milk tits... built the future."
"In position at the northeast tower. Beginning assault."
"In position at the east tower. Let our final dance begin!"
"In position at the northwest tower. Drinks on me fer those who survive!"
"In position at the west tower. Numbers looking good."
"In position at the south tower. THIS IS IT...!"
"Failed... we can\'t win like this..."
"Failed... fickle fate does not favor us..."
"Failed... time to sober up..."
"Failed... there is no profit in this..."
"Failed... no... everyone back in position... AGAIN!"
"Northeast tower secure. Bringing it offline."
"East tower secure. Its proud hum is finally silenced."
"Northwest tower secure. Just... smash tha\' panel over there or somethin\'!"

"South tower secure. THE BARRIER IS DOWN! SEIGE THE GATESSSSS! WOOOOOOOO WAR IS SO EXCITING!!!"
"Disgusting creature, consider yourself blessed."
"Hmmnnn... you have... some skill..."
"Fuck harder, you useless thing! Bury your filthy member deeper inside me..."
"Ah! Yes! Do you want to fill my bitch cunt? I want to feel your foul seed spread inside me! Cum now!"
"Y-you have... served me well..."
"I get the whole \'pack mentality\' thing, but what\'s the plan back there?"
"HEY! You are lucky your friend is making me so wet, but don\'t get any funny ideas..."
"Hnnnnnnnnnnnggggg.... ah! Not so ... hhnggg... rough!"
"Ah! Hhh...HARDER! I can feel your fucking cocks rubbing each other inside me!"
"Grrrrr! Rougher! Don\'t pull out! I want to feel your thick cock explode and have cum flow from my ass like a good little bitch!"
"I prefer machines... but I guess a good \'ol bio-dick now and then keeps things fresh."
"Please release me... this isn\'t right!"
"I... serve the swarm... you can\'t break me!"
"Y-yes! Please! Fuck me harder! I want to serve!"
"Ah! Master! Please bless me with your seed!"
"D-did I serve you well?"
"Welcome to the clan."
"You can take my body, but I will never serve you!"
"S-stop! Y-you can\'t!"
"Ah.. ah... ah... p-please... faster!"
"Yes! Cum inside of me!"
"I will make your dreams become reality..."
"To be so humilated! Not even the benefit of a warm partner whose heat and life can radiate through my being!"
"As this cold member drives deeper inside of me, I wonder if it wishes to know what life truly is? How can a machine care?"
"I-I k-know y-you d-don\'t u-understand b-but t-this i-is a-actually q-quite n-nice.. i-is t-there a f-faster s-setting?"
"Fuck! Yes! To be consumed once more by primal urges! Oh, glorious machination! Oh, heavenly construct! Bring forth your flood!"
"I wonder how much Pecunia sells these for?"
"You call us garbage? Now you are CUM dumpster!"
"Wicked burn.  I like your style, Lucky."
"Oh! Mistress! Me no see you. Drones being bad, attacking Gorgers!"
"Yes I saw that... you were very good in dealing with them.  Your magic... I haven\'t seen it before."

"I want you to join my personal guard. I could use someone like you."
"Oh... oh, of course! Me get ready right now!"
"A queen? What does that mean if you do not even have the power stand on your own? Your reality is a shadow of truth; an actor stumbling on the cosmic stage."
"Will you please shut the fuck up..."
"Simple whimperings from a simple mind. Perception is my domain and thus your reality is leased at my good grace... my home... I cast you out!"
"Your words are as empty as your illusions."
"Ah to be fallen once again. But is this battle a loss? For the greater cause, the destruction of a would be tyrant to enslave us all... is there truth in this sacrifice?"
"Mouth, pussy or ass?"
"Please say mouth, please say mouth, please say mouth!"
"You have me defeated, why further cast humiliation on one who only wanted to find truth in all this madness? Ever the conqueror, you would shame me."
"Rules are rules. I can\'t trust you if I don\'t turn you. I remember you liking anal. Take off your clothes and bend over."
"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH WHY DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE THE BUTT!"
"Shut it, Tiki. Dickmode. Now."
"Very well then, I shall once again bow my head to your cult of carnal desires. But I shall control my own pleasure in this endeavor..."
"Whatever floats your boat.  Reverse cowgirl it is."
"Okay, I wasn\'t expecting to fight you literally in OUTER SPACE."
"Is it not fitting that we fight on the cosmic stage? We were born in the last light of a collapsing star... do you not wish to die in the same beauty?"
"SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE! SPACE SPACE OOOOOOOOhhhhhhhhhhhhh..."
"W-wha.. how did... Very well, I will grant you this one ally, as truly someone should chronicle your defeat. She shall be the one to tell tale of this day!"
"Oh ho ho! Nice try! She slipped past your spell somehow, didn\'t she?"
"We were just in the tower with everyone then boooooooooooooooooom SPAAAAAAAAAAAAACE! So cooooooool!"
"Ahm. Would-be-Queen: how do you reign? Insisting your shadows have fled, do you believe your own lies? I wonder can you face your own truth?"
"The stars... they turn and turn with or without you behind them, gasping, desperately for air... bathe in their light, you ignorant child!"
"There is no denying your gravity... you pull in all life around you, changing, warping, not in control... see how easily you are displaced?"
"The universe expands and heaves like a dying beast, and you would sit at the epicenter with your scepter in hand? I would rather see the stars shatter and fall!"
"Foolish sibling, how many times must I tell you this is my reality you challenge? You think you can wound me?"
"God damnit, she just reversed all the damage I have done! I can\'t win like this!"
"I CAN HELP! I CAN HELP! When you are getting ready to knock her out, I will go disrupt her healing!"
"What would I do without you, Tiki?"
"AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW You neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed me!"
"Don\'t get cocky, kid. I will empower you when I whittle her down again. Stay frosty."
"We don\'t have to do this the hard way, Vinara. You know you aren\'t going to win."
"Bish yu com inta mi hous an star talkn yer shet?"
"Whooooooooooooooooooo this place is STACKED! Let\'s get WASTED!!!!"
"I lik yer attetud lil bud!"
"Tiki, game face!"
"Sorry!"

"Bish, yu cant hert me, gota speshul drenk jus fer this!"

"AHHHHHHHHHHHH HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA"
"I think I am gonna be sick..."
"Yoo culd nevr hold yer liqer! HAHAHAHAAHAHAAAAAAAA"
"Closing time, Vinara."
"Hunggggg.... not so loud...."
"And like magic your drunken slurring is gone."
"Heyyyyyyy wait a minute!"
"Yeah, yeah whatever, \'ya bitch.  Just get it over with."
"Sure you don\'t want a drink first?"
"So wait... we OWN all this booze now, right?"
"Yeah, we can throw a party later. Right now, you have a job to do."
"Stay away from the expensive stuff you little twat!"
"You\'ll be lucky if I don\'t shove all these bottles up your ass."
"Time to pay up, Pecunia."
"Seriously, how fucking arrogant can you be. You were NEVER fit to rule."
"And you are? Make this easy on yourself. The game has changed, I am not powerless anymore."
"Yeah... I was really hoping you would at least have control over Somna before I had to play this card."
"Here we go. What\'s the master plan?"
"Heh. You really don\'t know anything. You don\'t even know what the game is."
"And you know everything, right?"
"I know why Dad rigged the first war in your favor. I know where he planned to exile you to. I know a lot of things."
"Rigged? What are you talking about?"
"Not important now. Do you really think it was coincidence that the island you landed on had the ONE creature in all the Nether that could restore some ability to you?"
"Tiki? What is she talking about?"
"I don\'t know!"
"It\'s true, she doesn\'t know what she is. I had to make her that way."
"Make her?"
"Mistress, I don\'t know wha-"
"Admin override code P L G 3 2 1 0 4."
"PERSONALITY_OVERRIDE_CONFIRMED//ADMIN_RECOGNIZED//INITIATING_POWER_DRAIN"
"Hurrrrrrrrrk.... what....! Tiki!"
"There is that arrogance. In 1000 years, you never bothered to convert her. It was just impossible to believe that anyone couldn\'t be in love with you."
"I can\'t....."
"No. You can\'t. \'Your\' power comes through her, and she belongs to me. So here is how this is going to work."
"We are going to go back, you are going to pretend I was converted. Don\'t worry, I will be oh-so-humble."
"You will turn Somna. You will turn Irania. You can even be Queen! I really don\'t care about titles, but I will own you."
"It is a good deal, Eva. You get all the fame and glory and love you want, and I will quietly rule from behind the curtain."
"How long have you been planning this for?"
"When I found out the truth about Dad. Your little friend was on a failsafe trigger. Soon as you turned me in the first war, she went on auto-pilot."
"So 1000 years of planning... man is it going to suck when I take you down."
"Hah! There is that fighting spirit we all love. You need some persuasion? Fine. Have your little struggle."
"Tiki... I know you are in there somewhere..."
"COMMAND_NOT_RECOGNIZED//P-CORE_LOCKED//CODE_2313145639"
"This should be fun."
"Tiki... I...."
"Superior planning and technology yields superior results."
"You think I didn\'t plan for this?"
"Damnit!"
"Shit, where the hell did she go?"
"She ran away..."
"She is around here somewhere - there is too much on the line now."
"When you are right, you are right!"
"Look out!"
"I thought giant death machines were out of fashion?"
"Everyone knows fashion is cyclical. Besides, sometimes the oldies are the goodies."
"You.... bitch...."
"Superior planning and technology yields superior results."
"Awwww... looks like I broke your toy."
"Don\'t fret about it, I have plenty in stock."
"So what now?"
"Now it\'s just you and me."
"And me!"
"And her."
"Play time is over, bitch, let\'s do this."
"You.... bitch...."
"Superior planning and technology yields superior results."
"The best laid plans of mice and stupid bitches...."
"Cute... but you should know me better by now, Eva..."
"*gulp*"
"Hrnnnng...."
"She took a pill or something! IS SHE DEAD?!?! DID SHE KILL HERSELF!?!"
"No, she\'s alive she is just unconscious..."
"Well we can\'t... I mean... you know..."
"Uck... my head..."
"Oh good."
"Eva... what are... this lab..."
"Memory loss? Sorry, Pecunia, I don\'t buy it."
"I..."
"This looks like an interesting machine. Time to strap in!"
"Tiki, looks like you can go in over here."
"YOU CAN\'T JUST PLUG ME INTO SOME MACHINE!!!!!!!"
"Watch me."
"Somna! There is nowhere left to run!"
"Yeah... you are right."
"Right! And... um... so you give up?"
"Sure."
"So... seriously? You just give up?"
"Sigh.... do you WANT me to fight you?"
"No, I mean, that\'s fine. I guess I was just expecting more."
"Whatever."
"Gotta say, this is a refreshing change of pace."
"Eva."
"What\'s up?"
"This is taking too long. You are soooo boring."
"How did I even lose?"
"I... have no idea."
"Man, why couldn\'t they all be like that!"
"So. Boring. Just do whatever already."
"Geez, don\'t sound so excited."
"HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY LISTEN!"
"What is it?"
"Can we just, you know? BE NORMAL!!!!"
"What does she mean?"
"NO BUTTS, NO MACHINES, NO WIERD CRAP!"
"Yeah, just do whatever so I can get back to work."
"You two are being real buzz kills right now."
"Sigh..."
"No... I can\'t fail now..."
"We\'ll never get inside!!!"
"No... I can\'t fail now..."
"We\'ll never get inside!!!"
"Out of options..."
"We have to do something! DO ANYTHING!"
"I apologize for my delay."
"Bridgette! You are alive!"
"All things serve the Divine, even Death."
"Well that is fucking disturbing as shit."
"I AM SOOO HAPPPYYYYYYYYY!!!!!"
"The way is clear. Shall we proceed into the castle?"
"I think we need to take a second for a breather."
"OHHHH IS THERE A SCAR?!?!?!?!"
"TIKI! That\'s rude.... although... maybe we should take a look."
"If that is what you wish."
"I missed you, my angel."
"I am going to bring you back, kid!"
"ERROR_DETECTED//P-CORE_OVERWRITE//??//ACTIVATING_PULSE//PLEASE_MOVE"
"Snap out of it, Tiki, I need you!"
"P-PROTOCOL_OVERRRRRRRRIDE//EN-5Mistress?//??"
"I know you are in there somewhere!"
"PERSONALITY_CORE_LOCKED//Mistress-I//CORE_SEALED"
"I don\'t care what she says you are!"
"P_CORE_BREACH//Iwontletyouhurther//??ERRORIN%-"
"Tiki. You are the only one who ever cared about me without being forced. I can\'t lose you."
"PCOR@##BR33CH??//Mistress!"
"Tiki! Are you okay?"
"I... I don\'t understand what\'s going on... did I?"
"Doesn\'t matter. Game face, kid!"
"Right! Let\'s do this!"
"Looks like your programming could use some work, Sis."
"Pfft. Let\'s see you build an insanely intricate magitech device that functions perfectly after 1000 years."
"What are we running short on troops or something?"
"No... we actualy have a fairly significant army. But they can\'t just all follow you around. These troops are the ones serving as your personal guard."
"I see.  And I suppose you have your own personal guard?"
"Yes. There are 36 squads under your command. This one is just under your direct command."
"I see... well anyone we turn along the way gets an auto-pass into my \'personal guard\'"
"As you wish. Although I wouldn\'t recommend too much bloat."
"I suppose you are right. I will send any excess troops to back to the islands to worship me."
"Tsk. Waste of resources."
"So what can I do from this command post?"
"Review your troops. Equip them as you see fit. Form your battle squadron. Full service stop."
"And if I just want to watch them bang each other?"
"Seriously? Whatever. Fine. Yes. IF you want to just sit around and watch your forces bang each other you can summon them to your chambers."
"Now we are talking."
"You know it is wierd. I spent 1,000 years trying to get off this island, but now it feels like home."
"I am so happy for you."
"Don\'t be bitter. It has really shaped up, and now with the portals active, it serves as a nice little temple to my greatness!"
"So this is where you are sending our \'excess\' forces. You SHOULD be sending them to the frontlines."
"Pish, posh. They serve us better here. The more that join the chant, the stronger I get - and the stronger our forces on the field linked to me get."
"I suppose you have a point."
"Like most things, it is about quality not quantity, Beez. Well. Not dicks. Dicks are straight up quantity."
"Does everything have to be about sex with you?"
"Yes?"
"Hmmm... Pecunia\'s old robot is still here? We should get the store operating again. Some heavy weaponry would do us good."
"Good call, sis!"
"Actually, now that I look around, there is some decent equipment around here. Old, but decent. I haven\'t seen a rune forge in ages."
"Yeah... all we would need is someone who knows how to operate it."
"Well you are shit out of luck. There isn\'t anyone left alive who... actually... I think Vanorel has a book on it."
"That doesn\'t help us that much, now does it?"
"No one knows how to work this damn thing. Hate to say it, but we need Vanorel."
"Well?"
"Hmmmm... I have worked with WORSE... but do not fear, my skill is great."
"So what does it do?"
"Oh it is FAR too complicated for you to understand, don\'t worry your pretty little self."
"Idiot. It pulls the energy from the runic material and compresses them into an enhanced form."
"How will I know what result to expect?"
"Well, the element will end up the same as one of the materials. Hard to say which. If you want something in particular, I would load up that type."
"And it will always be more powerful?"
"Again, depends on the material. You put weak and mid level runes in, you could get mid or high level. Just be smart about what you use."
"SIGH"
"Fuck off, Van. Do your job."
"This freaking thing. You know the stupid piece of crap never even had more than a moldy old set of leather and some crappy sword?"
"You are surprised a crappy product came from a crappy dealer?"
"Hey now, to be fair, I always intended to have him restock with better stuff. I guess I just never got around to programming it."
"Well the time for garbage is over. I need access to a real armory."
"Easy! I recalibrated his wormhole to one of my infantry supply warehouses. Go nuts."
"Good deal. Now we... hey. What is with this markup? You are charging me three times what its worth!"
"Whaaaaaaat? No I am not. The cost ends up a little higher because you have teleport fees, rust proofing, AppleCare, usage fees, monitoring fees, anti-junk fees..."
"I see. Luckily for me there is a neverending supply of souls to harvest, eh?"
"Heyyyyyyyy this place looks pretty nice.  When the hell was it built?"
"Eh, I think recently, actually. The troops demanded someplace to unwind away from the mainland."
"Well, if it is one place that will make you want to drink, it is this shitty rock."
"Hello, Miss, can I get you anything?"
"You look familiar..."
"Yes, Miss, you captured me when you initially took the Hive from my Lady Beezelba."
"Oh that\'s right! So now you run my bar? Well I suppose that is a promotion of sorts."
"I do love the work, Miss. Combat never sat well with me. This way I get to meet all sorts and hear the wildest stories!"
"Ever hear anything good?"
"Oh, all the time, Miss! Travelers come in with such stories and tales of great demon heroes."
"Like me?"
"Uh... not quite, Miss. Everyday heroes from the demon clans. Not quite royalty, but better than the lot of us!"
"Hmmm... unique heroes? Keep your ear to the ground, I want you to let me know if you get any leads on these \'heroes\'."
"Of course, Miss."
"Anything else going on?"
"Well... I also manage the requests made by your followers."
"What kind of requests?"
"Really could be anything, Miss. Whatever tickles their fancy - I just try to match the appropriate follower to the request."
"I will have to take a look; could be a good way to further earn their loyalty."
"Sounds wonderful, Miss! Please stop in anytime, and I will keep you up to date."
"So....."
"So what?"
"So what happened? A day ago you were all vengeance and \'death to Pecunia\', now you just forgive her? Just like that?"
"It is complicated. Short answer, this isn\'t the Pecunia who killed Bridgette, so why punish her for it."
"You just made me masturbate for 18 hours straight because I questioned your decision. She MURDERS your most powerful ally, and it\'s all cool now?"
"Does seem a wee bit fucked up there, sis."
"Different strokes for different folks... hahaahhaha... get it? Strokes?"
"BECAUSE YOU HAD TO JERK YOURSELF OFF!!!! HAHAHAHHAHA!!!!"
"Hilarious."
"I know jealously is LITERALLY your nature, especially of your twin, but you need to get over it. I have my reasons."
"Whatever. Fine. I am over it.  What now, Captain Douchenozzle?"
"Well we control the majority of the Nether now. Looks like Irania is turtling up in Demon\'s Claw. I say we go get Somna then end this war."
"Ya sure that\'s a good idea? If we leave her to her duty, I dun\' think she\'ll bother us assaultin\' Irania."
"Maybe... but I will probably need her power. Yeah, why risk it? Besides, it is on the way, so the conflict is inevitable."
"I\'ll give the order to cross the Blightwall."
"No news lately, Miss."
"There is quite a stir at the Hive, Miss. It appears the Gorgers have overstayed their welcome."
"Rumor has it a group of Drones has been targetting groups of Gorgers, and High Mystic Lucky has had enough."
"The Drones won\'t stop talking about this \'Master Ioshia\', Miss."
"Supposedly she is some super assassin. Rumor is she is training new students on the Blind Gate, but only if they come \'free of impure armaments\'"
"Oh, Miss! Sorry, I didn\'t hear you... I was at the most fantastic concert last night."
"The great Illosian singer, Photovol, has been performing at Shadefall. Although between shows, she won\'t see anyone who can\'t help her regenerate."
"Miss, I don\'t mean to disparage your Grace\'s sisters, but ... it\'s just I think we have been scammed."
"Lady Pecunia gave us an upgraded mechiza unit to help around the bar, but this \'VLAD//ROM\' just went on a rampage and fled."
"Then she said it was OUR fault for having more than 3 customers! I mean, really, Miss!"
"Everyone won\'t stop talking about Chef Jurassa. I guess she was left behind when we retook the Royal Gate?"
"She is the Netherealm\'s most famous Esurian Cutlarist! Her meals are... are divine! But she despises magic and will only seat a party of 8 unique diners."
"Bobakseuz...Bobakseuz...Boba-"
"EEP! I didn\'t see you there! The Phasmos have a legend that if you say Bobakseuz three times in a mirror, the dread stalker will appear!"
"It is silly, I know... just stories from our scouts along the Slumber Path..."
"Oh my gosh! Have you heard the news?!?!"
"Vintabas has issued a challenge to all the demon clans you control... she says our heros are weak like our Mistress!"
"Her words! Not mine! Nooooot mine! She is at the public forum saying they are too afraid to show up and fight her!"
"Me sorry... it not go well..."

"Lady Tiki was an excellent pupil, I can see why she is so popular. She will be very strong some day."
"I fucked your sister. It was okay. She kept saying she was going to synthesis my cock, whatever that means."
"This is the way! Merchants secured; escort complete. One of the other escorts pledged themselves to your cause."
"The lessons went very well.  She handles a blade naturally and with excellent style. She offered a servant as thanks."
"Targets dispatched. I killed a few patrols on the eastern roads. One got away, but I caught up and corrupted \'em for you."
"Production is back in line. I made the organization more efficient - one of the workers can even be moved to the army."
"The interrogations went well. The prisoner was resistant, but I broke \'em body and soul. They will serve you well."
"That was an... interesting experience. I have never met someone so excited by honey. She sent a vassel as thanks."
"I have served you beautifully! The barriers are secure and sound... truly works of art!"
"Hehehe... traps complete... I wish I could see the suckers\' faces when they fall into the spikes! Plop! Splat!"
"Do I have to come back already? I was enjoying the solitude so much... it was so... serene."
